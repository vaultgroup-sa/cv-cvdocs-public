# Authorization

A few API endpoints allow anonymous access.
All the rest require authorization using `Bearer` token which is JWT:
`Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`

For details about authorized client types (`unit`, `user`, `supervisor`) and permissions see [security] document.

# Actuator

Every application (microservice) exposes two anonymous (no authorization required) actuator endpoints:

* `/actuator/health` – a simple health check endpoint;
* `/actuator/info` – exposes some information about application (like artifact, version and timestamp of build).

# General

All the date/time values across all API endpoints are represented in ISO-8601 timestamp format unless explicitly stated
otherwise.
The part which represents fractions of second is optional (both examples are valid):

* `2022-05-05T10:19:03.432Z`
* `2022-05-05T10:19:03Z`

In case of error a proper HTTP response code is used and the `application/json` response body format is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Certain error occurred"
  },
  {
    "field": "unit_id",
    "message": "Invalid UUID value"
  },
  ...
]
```

There is an array of one or more error objects. Each one must have `message` property which contains human-readable
description or what went wrong.
If it's an error that is related to a certain request param, path variable or form field then the error object will also
have `field` property.

There are plenty of validation errors caused by malformed or unexpected values of certain request parameters
or `application/json` request body object properties. So keep that in mind and make sure to provide generic error
handling.

## POST `/management/user`

Create new user/supervisor.

When creating a new user you must specify its initial permissions (see [security] document). To adjust permissions
afterward (see `PUT /management/user/{id}/permissions` endpoint) you will need `user.permissions.edit` permission with
proper targets.

#### Access: `user` or `supervisor` having `user.create` permission

To create user within certain account you need that account to be a permission target of `user.create` permission.
To create supervisor you need `urn:*` as a permission target of `user.create` permission.

#### Request body: `application/json`

```json
{
  "account_id": "0697b16e-ddcc-4711-b072-906fdcc05270",

      ],
      "target_urns": [
        "urn:*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

*Required fields:*

* `username` a unique name of the new user (will be converted to lower case during saving);
* `permissions` the permissions to be granted to the new user. You cannot give new user an access wider than you have so
  all the specified permissions and permission targets will be validated and automatically erased to meet that
  requirement.

*Optional fields:*

* `account_id` an identifier of an account to create user within (omit to create a supervisor);
* `full_name` a full name of a user, can be used as a description (up to 255 characters).

## POST `/management/card/{id}/revoke`

Revoke an access card from user/supervisor or account it was assigned to.

* If the endpoint is being called by `supervisor` then the card is revoked from its owner (a user) **and** from account.

  see `POST /management/unit/{id}/cards/attach` and `POST /management/unit/{id}/cards/detach` endpoints).
* If the endpoint is being called by `user` then the card is revoked from its owner (a user) **but** stays assigned to
  an account. In that case all the associations with units are kept untouched.

#### Access: `user` or `supervisor` having `card.edit` permission to access a card and `card.assign` permission to access account and/or user (depends on whether a card is assigned to a user or just to an account)
